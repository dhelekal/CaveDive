	abstract = {Many population genetic models have been developed for the purpose of inferring population size and growth rates from random samples of genetic data. We examine two popular approaches to this problem, the coalescent and the birth窶電eath-sampling model ({BDM}), in the context of estimating population size and birth rates in a population growing exponentially according to the birth窶電eath branching process. For sequences sampled at a single time, we found the coalescent and the {BDM} gave virtually indistinguishable results in terms of the growth rates and fraction of the population sampled, even when sampling from a small population. For sequences sampled at multiple time points, we find that the birth窶電eath model estimators are subject to large bias if the sampling process is misspecified. Since {BDMs} incorporate a model of the sampling process, we show how much of the statistical power of {BDMs} arises from the sequence of sample times and not from the genealogical tree. This motivates the development of a new coalescent estimator, which is augmented with a model of the known sampling process and is potentially more precise than the coalescent that does not use sample time information.},
